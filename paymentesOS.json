    "description": "# Overview\n\nThe PaymentsOS API allows merchants to accept payments using a variety of methods in different currencies. The API is built on REST principles, ensuring that it is a well structured and predictable API. For ease of use, it incorporates strong HTTP features such as verbs and response codes.\n\n## Live vs. Test\n\nWe strongly recommend that you test your integration before going live. For this purpose, we provide a test environment in addition to the live environment, for testing your API requests.The test environment is completely separate from the live environment and the banking networks. It provides a safe place to develop and test your integration. It allows you to simulate all the relevant requests, and directs them either to the provider's sandbox, if they have one, or to a mock provider.\n\nSwitching between the two environments is easily done, by replacing the relevant keys, and updating the `x-payments-os-env` request header key to either `live` or `test`. The default of the `x-payments-os-env` header key is `live` if not specified, or if an unrecognized value is provided.\n\n## API Versioning\n\nThe `api-version` request header specifies the version of the API platform that should process the request. Sending this header with each API request ensures that your integration will continue to work in the way it was designed, and will not be negatively affected by future upgrades that could potentially break it.  Read our [changelog](https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/paymentsos-api-changelog.html) to view all the changes in our API.\n\nTo ensure that your request uses the correct API version, make sure to include the api-version header in all API requests. If the api-version header is not included in an API request, then 1.0.0 is used as the default API version.\n\n\n## Idempotency\n\nUsing the Idempotency feature is a way of preventing double charges and data corruption caused by sending duplicate requests.\n\nTo send a post request that is \"Idempotent safe\", simply include an `idempotency-key` header. The `idempotency-key` must be unique and should only be used in one request. The content of the key is completely up to you. For example, you can use some transaction related string, or generate a random string.\n\n### Re-sending a request until you get a response\n\nYou can safely re-send a request containing an `idempotency-key`, within the \"24 hour safe-retry window\", until you actually get a response from the server.\n\n### Re-sending a request after receiving certain error responses\n\nThe following error responses allow you to continue re-sending the same request. In such cases you should make sure to use the same `idempotency-key`, to avoid creating multiple resources:\n\n* Error response: 500 - Server Error\n* Error response: 503 - Service Unavailable\n* Response Category: provider_error\n* Response Category: provider_network_error\n\n## Customer Device\n\nYou can include information about the customer device when sending a Create Authorization or Create Charge request. This information can be used later to route transactions accordingly. To send this information, simply include the `x-client-ip-address` and/or the `x-client-user-agent` headers in the request.\n\n## Expanding Objects\n\nGET requests sometimes retrieve associated resource objects. For example, Payment attributes may include associated Authorization objects and Capture objects. By including the `expand` parameter in your request, you can retrieve the full set of attributes for selected associated resources. Enter a list of resources to expand, or 'all' to expand all associated resources. For example, to expand the Payment Method resource returned in a GET payments request, add the following to the end of the request, `?expand=payment_method`.\n\n## Minor Unit Currency Format\n\nAll amounts and prices must be formatted in <a href=\"https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/minor-currency-units.html\" target=\"_blank\">Minor Units</a>.\n\n## Additional Details\n\nYou may want to include additional data in your request. For example, when charging for a taxi service, you may want to include the name of the taxi driver in the payment request. If desired, you can also use the additional data when configuring route rules that determine how your transactions are routed (for more information, see <a href=\"https://developers.paymentsos.com/docs/control-center.html#route-and-block-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Route and Block Rules</a>).\n\nTo support your custom data, some API resources include a multi-purpose `additional_details` field in key/value format. The content of this field is entirely up to you, and we will not send it to any third party.\n\n## Responses\nPaymentsOS returns standard HTTP status codes as part of the response to all API requests.\n\n <table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>200 - OK</strong></td>\n    <td>The HTTP request was successful.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>201 -&nbsp;Created</strong></td>\n    <td>A new resource was created.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>400 - Bad Request</strong></td>\n    <td>The request failed due to a syntax error, or is missing a required parameter.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>401&nbsp;-&nbsp;Unauthorized</strong></td>\n    <td>No valid API key provided.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>404 - Not Found</strong></td>\n    <td>The requested resource does not exist.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>405&nbsp;-&nbsp;Method&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Allowed</strong></td>\n    <td>The request method is not supported for the requested resource.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>409 - Conflict</strong></td>\n    <td>The request conflicts with the state of the resource.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>500 - Server Error</strong></td>\n    <td>Server problem. <br><strong><em>Note</em></strong> - Re-sending the request is allowed. Use the same <code>idempotency-key</code>, to avoid creating multiple resources.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>503&nbsp;-&nbsp;Service&nbsp;Unavailable&nbsp;</strong></td>\n    <td>The provider's server is currently unavailable. <br><strong><em>Note</em></strong> - Re-sending the request is allowed. Use the same <code>idempotency-key</code>, to avoid creating multiple resources.</td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n  ### Errors\n\n  When an API request fails (HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range), an **Error** object is returned as part of the response. No other API resources are created, retrieved or returned.\n\n  <h4>The Error Object</h4>\n       <table>\n          <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td><strong>Attribute Name</strong></td>\n            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><strong>category</strong>\n            <br><i>string</i></td>\n            <td>The response category.

You can see the transaction status in the **Result** object, which is part of the resource that is returned.\n\n  <h4>Result Object&nbsp;</h4>\n    <table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>Attribute Name</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>status</strong>\n    <br><i>string</i></td>\n    <td>The status of the result.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><strong>category</strong>\n    <br><i>string</i></td>\n    <td>The response category.

Addtional `sub_categories `may be added from time to time.\n        <table>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n        <td><strong>duplicate_request</strong></td>\n        <td>This request is a duplicate of a previously sent request.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td><strong>expired_card</strong></td>\n        <td>The card has expired.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td><strong>declined_by_issuing_bank</strong></td>\n        <td>The transaction was declined by the Issuing bank.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td><strong>declined_by_acquiring_bank</strong></td>\n        <td>The transaction was declined by the Acquiring bank.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td><strong>declined_on_fraud_check</strong></td>\n        <td>The transaction was declined for fraud reasons.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n         <td><strong>incorrect_cardholder_data</strong></td>\n         <td>The cardholder data (CVV, AVS, 3DS, Name, email) as submitted is incorrect.
